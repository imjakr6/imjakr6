- 👋 Hi, I’m Jake Lund
- 👀  My whole life I have been interested in technology, especially computers, which led me to a career as a developer. Now I am passionate about making applications 
enjoyable by focusing on creating apps based on what the user wants. I am currently working towards being a full-stack developer that can get any job done but specialize more towards the front-end and having the end-used be as satisfied as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will improove my skills as a full-stack developer. 
- 📫 You can reach me by Email at <jakeandrewlund@hotmail.com>
